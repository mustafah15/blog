            Hello!üëãüèΩ 
            My name is Mustafa Hussain. I am a software engineer who spends the
            majority of his time seeking out new, innovative solutions related to the software engineering.
            That being said, I always do my best to develop high-quality backend solutions for my clients.
            In the 7+ years that I have spent as part of the software engineering industry, 
            I have managed to build a lot of stuff that helped me to improve both my collaboration skills and my analytical skills.
            Building highly scalable backend services is something that I am always interested in.
            Apart from being a software engineer, I also like to spend some of my time reading, making coffee and doing a long distance running. 
            I guess you can say that I am a bit of an imposter, but it makes me exactly who I am.
            </p>
