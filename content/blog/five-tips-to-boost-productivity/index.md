I have been working from home since April 2019,
and maintaining productive working hours can be difficult for remote workers especially at the beginning.
Here are five tips I have found the most helpful for me during my remote working time.

### 1. Daily Highlights

This was a tip I have picked up from [Make Time book by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time),
One of the key ideas from this book is that everyday we should have a single highlight,
The one thing we are going to focus on for the day.
Having one important thing to focus on every day and getting it done,
like for example writing this blog or studying two chapters from a specific course,
gives me the satisfaction, and the motivation of getting at least one thing is getting done every single day. This of course helped me to increase my daily productivity because I have a clear goal for each day to work on and get it done.

### 2. Weekly Planning

Weekly planning is a kind of my productivity shield.
Scheduling my daily highlight time and all my important tasks a week ahead was really a good defensive mechanism from the urgent tasks and meetings that pop up non-stop,
Of course you can't prevent 100% of all the urgent tasks,
but at least I have an excuse not do urgent tasks because my day is already blocked by other tasks.

### 3. Waking up Early

Waking up early is really helping me to have productive days.
I usually get from 3 to 4 hours of distraction-free time before I start my 9 to 5 work.
Those hours I usually spend working on my daily highlight.
What really helped me to form waking up early as a habit is having a morning routine by making delicious morning coffee as the first thing of my day and having an obvious goal for the day which I already set when I do the weekly planning.

### 4. Having a Dedicated Office Space

Having an office space is really important for my productivity,
because my mind is set to have work in this specific area.
It doesn't have to be a fancy desk setup,
But at least a chair and a table located in a specific place is known for you and others who are living with you
that it's where you will be working on the important stuff.
which means it's not the best time for distractions.

###5. Exercises
I think it's not possible for me now to have a productive day without doing some physical exercises.
Imagine setting down in your desk chair for 8 to 10 hours a day,
The first 2 hours should be productive and okay, but after that you definitely will start to feel fatigued. So the solution I have found is that going for a run in the middle of my day around 4 PM really helps me to energize,
and I can get back to work full of energy again.

At the end this is mostly how I have become more productive. You can also improve your productivity by following those tips, Or you can come up with some other tips more helpful for you.
